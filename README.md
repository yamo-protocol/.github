# 🌐 YAMO Protocol  
### Immutable Provenance for Agentic Reasoning

YAMO is an open protocol that enables AI agents to anchor reasoning traces, intents, and decisions to an EVM-compatible blockchain with optional IPFS deep bundling. It provides a unified, verifiable, and cryptographically secure foundation for agentic cognition.
